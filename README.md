# Neko Mono 🐈

**Neko Mono** is a collection of personal experiments focusing on creating legible yet fun coding fonts, based on [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/).

## "Hachimi"

Hachimi is the first published design from Project Neko Mono. I'm quite satisfied by it and have been using it continuously as the primary coding font for a long time. It features a unique combination of glyphs that makes a fun experience, but also does not compromise on legibility. It is suitable for both long-time coding, reading and writing.
